    <h3 style="color: whitesmoke;"> A short biography of Lata Mangeshkar: </h3></center>
    <ul>
        <li>Lata Mangeshkar (born September 28, 1929), popularly called Lataji, was an Indian singer and an occasional music-composer. </li>
        <li>She was also known by the epithet "Melody queen".  </li>
        <li>The family’s surname was originally Hardikar, but Deenanath changed it to ‘Mangeshkar’ to relate it with his native place Mangeshi in Goa.</li>
        <li>Lata’s childhood name was Hema. She was renamed after a character, Latika, from one of her father’s plays. </li>
        <li>The first fruits of Classical Music were tasted by Lata Mangeshkar under the auspicious training of her own father.</li>
        <li>she is the daughter of the well known Drama Troupe Owner in Marathi- Pandit Dina Nath Mangeshkar.</li>
        <li>But the sky fell down when in 1942 with the demise of Pandit Dina Nathji, the mantle of responsibilities naturally fell on to the shoulders of Lata who was barely thirteen.</li>
        <li>But destiny was not cruel altogether. Vinayak Damodar, the owner of Navyug Chitrapat Company looked after them.</li>
        <li>Her first Hindi song was also for a Marathi movie in 1943.</li>
        <li>In 1945, she moved to Mumbai, where she started learning Hindustani classical music from Ustad Amanat Ali Khan.</li>
        <li>After partition, the latter migrated to Pakistan. So she started learning from Amanat Khan Devaswale and Pt Tulsidas Sharma. </li>
        <li>Lata got her first break in 1948 when she sang a song in the Hindi film ‘Majboor’ composed by music director Ghulam Haider.</li>
        <li>The rest is history as we all know. Since then, she never looked back.</li>
        <li>Her voice has given life, flesh and blood to thousands of songs in numerous languages.</li>
        <li>Her voice symbolises the voice of India or India singing to the world.</li>
        <li>If there are things that have for ages divided the people, her voice has the force to unite and bind people through the string of her sweet voice.</li>
        <li>Her voice has echoed through decades and still emerges as a clear, distinct and representative voice of an entire nation, and era.</li>
        <li>The white silk saree with a traditional red border and plait have become a trademark symbol of Lata Mangeshkar.</li>
